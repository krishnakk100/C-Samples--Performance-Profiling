# C-Samples--Performance-Profiling
The repo contains two C samples, along with complete VS project. To get started, clone the files to your local PC, unzip and import the
project in VS (recommended to us VS15)

Brief description of the sample code:

1. Matrix Code
The matrix code allows you to explore the various capabilities of the Intel® VTune™ Amplifier tool for analyzing threaded applications.

2. Tachyon Code
The tachyon sample is a 2-D raytracer/renderer that shows how different types of Intel® VTune™ Amplifier analysis help identify 
performance bottlenecks in the code, how algorithm optimization techniques affect the application performance, and how you can localize 
the performance changes you got after optimizations.
